# My NixOS Setup

This is my personal NixOS configuration for a clean, keyboard-focused development machine. I built it to keep things simple, consistent, and distraction-free while coding.

## Try Out

```bash
# Run the VM demo
nix run github:knoopx/nix

# Or clone and run locally
git clone https://github.com/knoopx/nix
cd nix
nix run .#vm
```

## What I Focus On

- **Minimal clutter**: Shell has no widgets and apps take the whole vertical space. Pressing `Super` reveals the overlay with the widgets.
- **Unified styling**: Consistent colors, fonts, and styles across:
  - System GTK/Qt themes and custom Neuwaita icon theme (merged with MoreWaita)
  - Terminal emulators (Kitty)
  - Text editors (VSCode, Helix)
  - Web browsers (Firefox with custom userstyles and GNOME theme)
  - Window manager (Niri with custom color schemes)
  - Desktop shell (Astal with theme-aware widgets)
  - All applications via Stylix theming system
- **Reproducible**: Everything's declarative, so I can set it up the same way anywhere

## Software

### Main Components

- **[Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri)**: A modern, Wayland-native tiling window manager that provides efficient keyboard-driven window management. It supports custom layouts, workspaces, and seamless integration with the desktop environment for a distraction-free coding experience.

- **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)**: Web browser optimized for privacy with [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) for ad-blocking, custom search engines, and userstyles for consistent theming. Includes policies for enhanced security and performance thanks to [BetterFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox) and GNOME theme integration
