# JavaScript/TypeScript Guidelines

- Use ES6 import syntax at the top of each file.
- Use `console.log` with emojis for logging.
- Always use explicit type annotations in TypeScript.
- Prefer arrow functions for callbacks and short functions.
- Use destructuring for objects/arrays when appropriate.

// React + MobX .cursorrules

// Prefer functional components with hooks

// MobX best practices

const mobxBestPractices = [
  "Use MobX-react-lite for optimal performance with functional components",
  "Implement stores for managing application state",
  "Utilize computed values for derived state",
  "Use actions for modifying observable state",
  "Implement proper error handling in asynchronous actions",
];

// Additional instructions

const additionalInstructions = `
1. Use TypeScript for type safety with MobX
2. Implement strict mode for MobX for better debugging
3. Use observer HOC or useObserver hook for reactive components
4. Implement proper dependency injection for stores
5. Use reaction for side-effects based on observable changes
6. Utilize MobX DevTools for debugging
7. Follow MobX best practices for scalable state management
